- The "Super Engine" (NT-Ω) was evaluated as theoretically perfect (scoring highest on 3-Law criteria) but underperformed in the specific 1200th draw due to overfitting to statistical averages, failing to capture the "outlier" pattern (1, 2, 4 start).
- The 3-Law system is justified by this evaluation: Law 2 inherits the Super Engine's statistical logic, while Law 3 (Shape) is necessary to capture the anomalies that the Super Engine filters out.
