# Prediction Set Round 1213 (M=50)
> 이 파일은 2중 잠금 및 NTLOTTO V3 전역(Global) 헌법 통제 하에 생성된 조합입니다.

## 전역 헌법 통계 (Global Selection Stats)
- Target M: 50, Generated: 50
- Max Overlap (All Pairs): 3 (보장 제한: 2, 단 EV 예외는 3)
- EV Slots Used (Overlap=3): 5 / 5 최대
- Max Number Frequency: 8 (Frequency Cap: 8)
- Max Jaccard Seen: 0.333

### 헌법 자체 검증 (Self-Verification)
- Overlap >= 4 존재여부: PASS 기록 (0건)
- Frequency 초과 위반: PASS 기록 (0건)
- 전역 헌법 무결성: PASS
